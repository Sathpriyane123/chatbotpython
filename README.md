Project Title: Voice-Assisted Chatbot
This project is a voice-assisted chatbot that integrates the Gemini API and Weather API to provide real-time information and assistance. The chatbot can perform tasks like answering queries, fetching weather updates, and interacting with users through voice commands.

Features
Voice Assistance:

Users can interact with the chatbot via voice commands.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) functionalities.
Gemini API Integration:

Enables the chatbot to answer queries related to specific topics.
Secure API key handling using a .env file.
Weather API Integration:

Provides current weather updates for any city.
Uses the OpenWeatherMap API.
Customizable Responses:

Flexible design to add more APIs or extend functionalities.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
APIs:
Gemini API
OpenWeatherMap API
Libraries:
python-dotenv for environment variable management
requests for API communication
speech_recognition for voice input
pyttsx3 for text-to-speech
Environment:
Virtual environment (myenv)
